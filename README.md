# Econometrics ICT Preparation 2025


This repository organises my preparation for the Econometrics ICT, focusing on panel data analysis, GARCH models, statistical testing, and all other sorts of econometric topics using UK Obesity and Unemployment Rates data.

## Purpose
To centralise code, data, notes, and practice for mastering Fixed Effects, GARCH, VAR, and other econometric techniques for the Econometrics ICT scheduled in 2025.

## Preparation Timeline

- **Day 1: Setup and Resource Gathering**
  - [x] Create sub-folders for each topic in the repository (`/Fixed_Effects/`, `/GARCH/`, etc.).
  - [ ] Gather relevant resources for each sub-folder from Brightspace (e.g., Artur Semeyutin’s example codes).
  - [ ] Upload Artur’s example codes to the respective sub-folders (e.g., GARCH code in `/GARCH/`).
  - [ ] Replicate Artur’s example codes in each sub-folder with my own versions.
  - [ ] Add consistent comments to my replicated code explaining each line for better understanding.
  - [ ] Include comments on potential outputs (e.g., coefficients, p-values) in the replicated code files.

- **Day 2: Deep Dive into Topics (Part 1)**
  - [ ] Select another topic sub-folder to start with (e.g., `/Fixed_Effects/`).
  - [ ] Create multiple R code examples for the selected topic (e.g., 3–5 Fixed Effects models).
  - [ ] Comment every line of code in each example to explain its purpose.
  - [ ] Run the R code examples and save the outputs (e.g., tables, graphs) in the sub-folder.
  - [ ] Add comments under every output value (e.g., “p-value = 0.03 suggests significance at 5% level”).
  - [ ] Write a short summary in the sub-folder (e.g., `fixed_effects_notes.md`) on what the output values mean.
  - [ ] Analyse implications of the outputs on trends/datasets (e.g., “Higher unemployment may correlate with obesity”).

- **Day 3: Deep Dive into Topics (Part 2)**
  - [ ] Continue with another topic sub-folder (e.g., `/GARCH/`).
  - [ ] Create multiple R code examples for the selected topic (e.g., 3–5 GARCH models).
  - [ ] Comment every line of code in each example to explain its purpose.
  - [ ] Run the R code examples and save the outputs (e.g., volatility plots) in the sub-folder.
  - [ ] Add comments under every output value (e.g., “α + β ≈ 1 indicates persistent volatility”).
  - [ ] Write a short summary in the sub-folder (e.g., `garch_notes.md`) on what the output values mean.
  - [ ] Analyse implications of the outputs on trends/datasets (e.g., “Volatility clustering in unemployment rates”).

- **Day 4: Deep Dive into Topics (Part 3)**
  - [ ] Aim to finish off all sub-folders by this day (e.g., `/VAR/`).
  - [ ] Create multiple R code examples for the selected topic (e.g., 3–5 VAR models).
  - [ ] Comment every line of code in each example to explain its purpose.
  - [ ] Run the R code examples and save the outputs (e.g., impulse response functions) in the sub-folder.
  - [ ] Add comments under every output value (e.g., “IRF shows unemployment response to obesity shock”).
  - [ ] Write a short summary in the sub-folder (e.g., `var_notes.md`) on what the output values mean.
  - [ ] Analyse implications of the outputs on trends/datasets (e.g., “Bidirectional causality between variables”).

- **Day 5: ICT Simulation (Preparation)**
  - [ ] Review work done in all sub-folders to consolidate understanding.
  - [ ] Perform a no-assistance attempt on the Mock ICT Paper on Brightspace.
  - [ ] Write R code to solve each question, storing them in a new `/Practice/` sub-folder.
  - [ ] Comment the code for each simulated question to explain the approach.

- **Day 6: ICT Simulation (Review and Insights)**
  - [ ] Perform a new attempt and run the R code for each ICT question and save outputs in `/Practice/`.
  - [ ] Add comments under each output value in the simulation code files.
  - [ ] Compare my solutions to Artur’s examples (if any) to check accuracy.
  - [ ] Document key insights from the simulations in a summary file (e.g., `ict_simulation_insights.md` in `/Practice/`).
